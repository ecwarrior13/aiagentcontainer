  - Leveraging server-side rendering and modern React features
  - Utilizing the new App Router for enhanced routing capabilities
- **Language**: TypeScript

  - Strict type checking
  - Enhanced IDE support and code reliability

- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI

  - Built on Radix UI primitives
  - Accessible and customizable components
  - Consistent design system foundation

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

  - Utility-first CSS framework
  - Rapid prototyping capabilities
  - Consistent design tokens

- **Package Management**: pnpm workspaces

  - Efficient dependency management
  - Monorepo structure support
  - Faster installation and better disk space usage

- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks

  - Centralized state management
  - Custom hooks for reusable logic
  - Context-based state isolation

- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod

  - Performance-focused form handling
  - Type-safe form validation
  - Reduced bundle size

- **Animation**: Framer Motion
  - Declarative animations
  - Gesture support
  - Performance optimized

## Technical Constraints
